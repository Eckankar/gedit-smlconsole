Installation instructions
=========================

Linux
-----
This guide assumes that you have gedit 2 or newer installed.

Copy the following files and folders to your gedit plugin folder:
* smlconsole.gedit-plugin
* smlconsole/ (including files)

Your plugin folder is located here:
* `~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/` for gedit 3.
* `~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins/` for gedit 2.

Once you've copied the files to the appropriate folder, restart
gedit, and the plugin should be listed in the plugin list
(`Edit > Preferences > Plugins`) under the name "SML Console".
